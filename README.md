# Unit-19-Homework: Cryptocurrency Wallet

This repository contains two Python files:

*krypto_jobs.py* - contains the code associated with the web interface of application. The code included in this file is compatible with the Streamlit library.

*crypto_wallet.py* - contains the Ethereum transaction functions. By using import statements, we've integrated the crypto_wallet.py Python script into the Fintech Finder interface program that is found in the fintech_finder.py file.
